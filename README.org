This is tested Model.fit implementation approach.

This example working with two parameter servers.

- run.sh - a starter script for smallmodel.py and interception of logs from strout and stderr from Tensorflow.
- smallmodel.py - MNIST dataset and perceptron NN.

For two and more parameter servers model.load will not work, you should use Tensorflow Serving.
